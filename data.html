        Data and Processing
      </h2>
            <p>
              The data used in these visualizations was taken from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3">SF Fire Department Calls for Service</a>.
              The data was first filtered by year to only show data from 2017, the year with the most incidents reported.
              The data was then filtered to include two specific incident types: medical incidents and traffic collisions.
              Both categories were analyzed using the same variables in order to compare them more effectively.


              <p>
              <br><u>Neighborhood Analysis</u> <br>
              Our graph titled, "Neighborhood Medical Incidents" filtered the top 30 neighborhoods with the most incidents reported.
              This narrowed down our data to include 30 categorical rows (each neighborhood) with a range from 0 to 486,862 number of records.
              </p>

              <p>
              The same was done with our graph titled, "Neighborhood Traffic Collisions", but with a range from 0 to 20,515 number of records instead.
              </p>


              <p>
              <br><u>Unit Type Analysis</u> <br>
              Our next set of graphs involved filtering the top 9 unit types dispatched to the scene of the incident as well as adding color to distinguish if it was a non-life-threatening or life-threatening incident.
              This added two more categorical rows to our data.
              In our graph titled, "Medical Incident Unit Types" we included 9 categorical rows (each unit type) with a range from 0 to 217,822 number of records.
              </p>

              <p>
              The same was done for our next graph titled, "Traffic Collision Unit Types", with a range from 0 to 11,258 number of records instead.
              </p>

              <p>
              <br><u>Monthly Report</u> <br>
              Our last set of graphs was filtered by the month the incident was entred by the 911 dispatcher in 2017 to show the recorded number of incidences occuring in each.
              Thus, our data used 12 categorical columns (each month) and our rows indicating the number of records.
              </p>

              <p>
                The graphs in this set are titled, "Monthly Medical Incidents" with a range from 0 to 18,996 and our "Monthly Traffic Collisions" has a range from 0 to 1,322.
              </p>
